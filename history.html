          <h2>Short History of Chess</h2>
          <p>
            The history of chess can be traced back nearly 1,500 years to its
            earliest known predecessor, called chaturanga, in India; its
            prehistory is the subject of speculation. From India it spread to
            Persia, where it was modified in terms of shapes and rules and
            developed into Shatranj. Following the Arab invasion and conquest of
            Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently
            spread to Europe via Spain (Al Andalus) and Italy (Emirate of
            Sicily). The game evolved roughly into its current form by about
            1500 CE. "Romantic chess" was the predominant playing style from the
            late 18th century to the 1880s. Chess games of this period
            emphasized quick, tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic
            planning. The Romantic era of play was followed by the Scientific,
            Hypermodern, and New Dynamism eras. In the second half of the 19th
            century, modern chess tournament play began, and the first official
            World Chess Championship was held in 1886. The 20th century saw
            great leaps forward in chess theory and the establishment of the
            World Chess Federation. In 1997, an IBM supercomputer beat Garry
            Kasparov, the then world chess champion, in the famous Deep Blue
            versus Garry Kasparov match, ushering the game into an era of
            computer domination. Since then, computer analysis – which
            originated in the 1970s with the first programmed chess games on the
            market – has contributed to much of the development in chess theory
            and has become an important part of preparation in professional
            human chess. Later developments in the 21st century made the use of
            computer analysis far surpassing the ability of any human player
            accessible to the public. Online chess, which first appeared in the
            mid-1990s, also became popular in the 21st century.

          <h3>Origin</h3>
          <p>
            Precursors to chess originated in India. There, its early form in
            the 7th century CE was known as chaturaṅga (Sanskrit: चतुरङ्ग),
            which translates to "four divisions (of the military)": infantry,
            cavalry, elephantry, and chariotry. These forms are represented by
            the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop,
            and rook, respectively. Chess was introduced to Persia from India
            and became a part of the princely or courtly education of Persian
            nobility. Around 600 CE in Sassanid Persia, the name for the game
            became chatrang (Persian: چترنگ), which subsequently evolved to
            shatranj (Arabic: شطرنج; Persian: شترنج) after the conquest of
            Persia by the Rashidun Caliphate, due to the lack of native "ch" and
            "ng" sounds in the Arabic language. The rules were developed further
            during this time; players started calling "Shāh!" (Persian for
            "King!") when attacking the opponent's king, and "Shāh Māt!"
            (Persian for "the king is helpless" – see checkmate) when the king
            was attacked and could not escape from attack. These exclamations
            persisted in chess as it traveled to other lands. The game was taken
            up by the Muslim world after the early Arab Muslims conquered the
            Sassanid Empire, with the pieces largely keeping their Persian
            names. The Moors of North Africa rendered the Persian term
            "shatranj" as shaṭerej, which gave rise to the Spanish acedrex,
            axedrez and ajedrez; in Portuguese it became xadrez, and in Greek
            zatrikion (ζατρίκιον), but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by
            versions of the Persian shāh ("king"). Thus, the game came to be
            called lūdus scacc(h)ōrum or scacc(h)ī in Latin, scacchi in Italian,
            escacs in Catalan, échecs in French (Old French eschecs), schaken in
            Dutch, Schach in German, szachy in Polish, šahs in Latvian, skak in
            Danish, sjakk in Norwegian, schack in Swedish, šakki in Finnish, šah
            in South Slavic languages, sakk in Hungarian and şah in Romanian;
            there are two theories about why this change happened: From the
            exclamation "check" or "checkmate" as it was pronounced in various
            languages. From the first chessmen known of in Western Europe
            (except Iberia and Greece) being ornamental chess kings brought in
            as curios by Muslim traders. The Mongols call the game shatar, and
            in Ethiopia it is called senterej, both evidently derived from
            shatranj. Chess spread directly from the Middle East to Russia,
            where chess became known as шахматы (shakhmaty, literally
            "checkmates", a plurale tantum). The game reached Western Europe and
            Russia by at least three routes, the earliest being in the 9th
            century. By the year 1000 it had spread throughout Europe.
            Introduced into the Iberian Peninsula by the Moors in the 10th
            century, it was described in a famous 13th-century Spanish
            manuscript covering shatranj, backgammon and dice named the Libro de
            los juegos, which is the earliest European treatise on chess as well
            as being the oldest document on European tables games. Chess spread
            throughout the world and many variants of the game soon began taking
            shape. Buddhist pilgrims, Silk Road traders and others carried it to
            the Far East where it was transformed and assimilated into a game
            often played on the intersection of the lines of the board rather
            than within the squares. Chaturanga reached Europe through Persia,
            the Byzantine empire and the expanding Arabian empire. Muslims
            carried chess to North Africa, Sicily, and Iberia by the 10th
            century. The game was developed extensively in Europe. By the late
            15th century, it had survived a series of prohibitions and Christian
            Church sanctions to almost take the shape of the modern game. Modern
            history saw reliable reference works, competitive chess tournaments,
            and many new variants. These factors added to the game's popularity,
            further bolstered by reliable timing mechanisms (first introduced in
            1861), effective rules, and charismatic players.
